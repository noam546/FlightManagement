# Flight Alert Notification System

This project is a backend system for tracking flight deals and notifying users when prices match their saved alerts. It's built using ASP.NET Core and RabbitMQ with a clean, event-driven architecture.

---

## System Overview

The system consists of the following services:

- **Mobile Client** â€“ where users create flight alerts
- **AlertService** â€“ stores alerts and matches them to flight deals
- **FlightFetcher** â€“ scrapes or fetches real-time flight prices and publishes them
- **Event Queue** â€“ connects services using asynchronous messaging (RabbitMQ)
- **NotificationService** â€“ delivers push notifications to users when a match is found

## Example Flow

1. **User Sets Alert**  
   A user opens the mobile app and creates a flight alert:
   - Route: **JFK â†’ LAX**
   - Date: **April 15**
   - Max Price: **$250**

   The mobile app sends this data to the backend, where it's stored in the database via the `AlertService`.

2. **Flight Deal Found**  
   The `FlightFetcher` service finds a new flight:
   ```json
   {
     "flightId": "DL123",
     "from": "JFK",
     "to": "LAX",
     "departureDate": "2025-04-15",
     "price": 249.99,
     "airline": "Delta",
     "foundAt": "2025-04-04T13:45:00Z"
   }
   ```
   It publishes this deal to the event queue.

3. **AlertService Matches the Deal**  
   `AlertService` subscribes to flight deal events. Upon receiving this one, it queries its database and finds that the userâ€™s alert criteria match this flight.  
   It then publishes a new event:
   ```json
   {
     "flightId": "DL123",
     "message": "ðŸš¨ Deal: JFK â†’ LAX for $249.99 on April 15!",
     "users": [
       {
         "userId": 123,
         "deviceToken": "abc123xyz"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **NotificationService Sends Push**  
   The `NotificationService` consumes this alert match event and sends push notifications to the user's mobile device.
